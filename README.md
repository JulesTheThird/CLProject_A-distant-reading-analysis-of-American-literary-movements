This repository contains the coding material we used for our project.

Proposal - Our project consists of creating a textual analysis tool for use with a selected corpus. The corpus was created by extracting selected texts from Project Gutenberg. It is structured according to authors and the connections between them. Therefore, the user is still able to interact and obtain his or her own results, but our main aim was to range the choice towards a theoretical canon. In this way, we are able to compare the results of close and distant readings and do a textual analysis on cultural data. 

The repository contains:
  [1] corpus - urls of the Project Gutenberg plain txt files of the selected works, divided by author. A list of the analysed movements is mentioned as a list at the     beginning.
  [2] texts extraction - code to extract and preprocess the texts to use for the analysis. We created (i) a code to directly scraping the texts from the urls; (ii) a code to locally store them.
  [3] text mining analyses - code to extract statistical measurements.
